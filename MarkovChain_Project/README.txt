README
---------------------------------------
There are 3 seperate files in this folder:
MarkovChain.m--Original code
MarkovChain.mlx- -Live Editor file of .m File
MarkovChainProject.pdf--Printable version og .mlx file

Both of the .m and .mlx files are conmplete and you can run them seperately.
Note:The original .m file I received have some little mistakes in it and I corrected them. In some version of Matlab (eg. MATLAB 2015a) the functions in .m file can not run as scripts and you should seperate them into seperate .m files and call these functions in your main.m file when you need them.
